"""Compose the README hero: three popover captures side by side on a
transparent canvas, center one the focal point, sides lifted slightly.

Inputs are raw window captures (shadow on transparent background, the
same kind compose-screenshots.sh consumes). Placement is computed from
each capture's opaque core (alpha ~255) so shadows overlap the gaps
instead of inflating them.

Usage: compose-readme-hero.py left.png center.png right.png out.png
